# Upfeed

Upfeed is a tool that checks your Upwork job feed periodically for new jobs, filters out unwanted jobs according to your rules, and sends you notifications for each new (not junk) job. It will also save all the jobs recorded each day to disk.

## Usage:

`upfeed -feed "upwork rss feed" -saveDir "directory where to save recorded jobs"
